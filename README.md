Welcome to the Personal Project Showcase App. This app shows perviously completed coding projects, allows you to add new projects, search/filter for a project, and delete any projects after you add them. When you add a project you can title it as well as provide a description of said project. 

All you have to do to get started is click on the project title box and begin inputting your project's title.
